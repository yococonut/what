Project Mercury 

This project is intended to provide an introduction to the topic of Relativity. Relativity is a topic many find too intimidating and
therefore end up retracting their curiosity for. Here, we introduce a topic that is roughly closer or easier to understand by 
simply knowing Keplerian orbits: the trajectories of planets around our sun. Out of the planets orbiting the sun, the closest and the most 
intriguing is Mercury. It's orbit is the most eccentric out of our Solar System, and it perihelion advances change orbit positions throughout
it's orbits. 

Overall, we created a code in Python and Javascript.
